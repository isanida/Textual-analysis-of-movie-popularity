x-men ++$++ 7.40 ++$++ ['action', 'sci-fi'] ++$++ in 1944 german occupied poland  a 13 year old boy is separated from his parents upon entry to a concentration camp  when he tries to get back in after the gates have been closed  he is restrained by four guards  the gates suddenly start to curl in towards the group  as though attracted by a magnetic force; the boy is then knocked unconscious by another guard  in present day  a girl named marie  is studying with her boyfriend at her house in meridian  mississippi  they hug together and they kiss  which knocks him out and he almost dies  she screams as her mother arrives  terrified  she decides to leave her home  in congress  senator robert kelly attempts to pass a "mutant registration act"  which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities  magneto begins his plans to level the playing field between mutants and humans  meanwhile  marie  now going by the name of rogue meets logan  also known as wolverine  at the local bar in canada  rogue's mutation makes her temporarily assume the powers of any mutant she touches  while wolverine possesses superhuman healing abilities  heightened senses  and metal claws that extend outwards from his knuckles  suddenly  both of them are attacked by sabretooth  a fellow mutant and an associate of magneto  cyclops and storm arrive and save wolverine and rogue  and bring them to the x mansion  a facility run by professor charles xavier  who leads a group of mutants who are trying to seek peace with the human race  educate young mutants in the responsible use of their powers  and stop magneto from starting a war with humanity  abducted by mystique and toad  senator kelly is brought to magneto  who tests a machine on kelly that artificially induces mutation  though kelly manages to escape imprisonment with his new abilities  after an accident causes rogue to use her powers on wolverine  she is convinced by mystique (disguised as classmate [[iceman  that xavier is angry with her and that she should leave the school  xavier uses cerebro to locate rogue at a train station  mystique infiltrates cerebro and sabotages the machine  at the train station  wolverine convinces rogue to stay with xavier  but a fight ensues when magneto  toad and sabretooth arrive to take rogue  arriving at xavier's school  kelly dissolves into a puddle of water when his mutation becomes unstable  the x men learn that magneto was severely weakened in the test of the machine on kelly  and wolverine realizes he intends to use rogue's ability to transfer his powers to her  so that she can power his machine in his place  possibly putting her life at risk  xavier attempts to use cerebro to locate rogue  but falls into a coma  due to mystique's earlier meddling with the device  jean grey fixes it and uses cerebro to find magneto's machine on liberty island  which magneto intends to use on the world leaders  who are meeting for a summit on nearby ellis island  just as the group arrives at the top of the statue  defeating toad and incapacitating mystique  magneto and sabretooth incapacitate the group and continue with their plans  magneto transfers his powers to rogue   who is forced to use them to start the machine  wolverine breaks free and initiates a fight with sabretooth  but is thrown off the top of the statue  wolverine returns  and cyclops  with jean's help  blasts sabretooth out of the statue  with jean's telekinesis stabilizing him  storm uses her abilities to send wolverine to the top of magneto's machine  with time running out  wolverine attempts to stop the machine and save rogue  but magneto  now having regained some of his strength  halts wolverine's claws  cyclops manages to find a clean shot  wounding magneto and allowing wolverine to destroy the machine  placing his hand to rogue's face  as she is dying  wolverine succeeds in transferring his regenerative abilities to her; professor xavier also recovers from his coma  the group learns  after seeing mystique impersonating senator kelly on a news broadcast  that  despite being stabbed by wolverine at liberty island  she is still alive  in an attempt to help him learn more about his past  xavier sends wolverine to a military base near alkali lake  xavier visits magneto in his plastic prison cell  and the two play chess  magneto warns his friend that he will continue his fight  to which xavier promises that he and the x men will always be there to stop him ++$++ beast storm   try to look for the highest vantage point  from what i can figure  he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island   it is my feeling that magneto has to  we all do i wish i could go     until he found tungsten thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb   he had the energy source  he had the vacuum   but he didn't have the filament   he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power the neuro filter acts like a surge protector  regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor's mind   it's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions what does that mean so where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration yes    only there's a problem   the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature   it's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to   the senator's body is literally burning itself out   scott    this machine kills people and i don't think magneto realizes it for what purpose correct     apparently  adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces   he used the adamantium in logan's dog tag to test it on the senator   and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration its core it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings  and he is using adamantium as its core i'm afraid without cerebro's help  he won't have the strength to heal himself    and without the neuro  filter    there's no cerebro can the professor repair his own mind i'm sorry   i'm not strong enough jean    can you storm  rogue     you take the south entrance   jean and i will go in here it's too far i'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission   jean  can you raise me up there uh huh into the hudson radar stealth mode checks out   all right  there'll be less security north of the george washington bridge   i'm taking her down he calls me sport one more time  and i'll blow a watermelon sized hole through him what's that i'll tell you one thing though well  i think that's perfectly understandable hey   i'm sorry   about logan   i was jealous no   i'm     i don't know if we can do this without charles are you all right we have to find magneto he's already losing control of his vitals   respiratory   cardiovascular  unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning  i'm afraid his vital signs are weak and getting weaker what's wrong with him if magneto is planning to use logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something you saw what happened tonight   you think magneto won't come after him again   you think he won't come here if necessary   this is a school  for god's sake what are you talking about i don't like him being here scott   i  sure you are  sport i'm o k   i'm o k shut up   i got no interest in you  xavier   or your    x men you know  you   i've served with men like you before  methodical   systematic    naive   you know what happens to those men in a real fight i don't remember   is that what you wanted to ask me how long have you been in alaska i wanted to talk to you inspiring    now what am i doing here yeah  i'll bet you have i've seen a lot of rings logan  do you see this ring what is it you're failing to get at  are you interested in me he takes himself seriously he takes his work seriously he's uptight suit yourself let go not interested what do you say were you now i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town he's busy right now you should always work with a spotter what if they're naughty if necessary by reading my thoughts maybe  the professor could help you with that yeah   well i don't like to talk about my past the professor said you were a solider  actually  i believe he used the word mercenary what if i like the pain i'll see what i can do    you should get some sleep   even with your healing ability  you're going to be hurting for a while i won't light the cigars   how about that there's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds some cigars   case of beer anything else i can get you i can assure you  there is no such creature in my genes the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change tell it to the ones that did this to me treat you like a mutant   we are not what you think   not all of us i'm sorry to come here  ms  grey   i was afraid if i went to a hospital  they would   senator dr  grey i can assure you  there is no such creature in my genes i presume nothing  i am here to tell you that in time  the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet   perhaps even your children  senator this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus  new jersey   a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him   i don't know where you come from  ms  grey  but where i come from  you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off   you do it the old fashioned way    you give 'em the finger   but what you presume to tell this committee  control  senator     we teach them control you wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to   math   history   science   english  athletics   ms  grey    you work at a school for mutants in westchester  new york   can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded  senator   the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous you're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing  ms  grey   three words: are mutants dangerous let's just say  god works too slowly what is it you intend to do to me intention   intention  senator   we are talking about mankind here   his fear   it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps   studied for weaknesses   and eventually wiped off the face of the earth the intention of registration act  gosh  i hope so whatever you do to me    no matter what you'll make me right   every word i have spoken will be confirmed you mutant bastards   mr  guyrich has been dead for some time senator you    wha    who are you    where is henry in the road to survival  there is always sacrifice logan   we are the future    not them   we must protect ourselves   after tonight  when the leaders of the world return home    they will return as brothers  as mutants    and our cause will be theirs   this is survival  i know you understand that  logan    or is it wolverine what are you going to do you're backstage at the encore of creation where am i you think i care about her   i'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here come with me and i'll let her live what do you want i do love a good check mate what     miss me   charley  i'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me  it won't be soon enough for everyone here why   you have a home here now  if you want it   everyone will   actually i'm feeling up to leaving they're all asking how you're doing  are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone don't you knock i'll go i've found her  westchester mall we were friends once     but that was a long time ago he helped you actually  magneto helped me put it together you designed this yourself the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being how to find rogue where are we going i believe he wants you for your adamantium no   that's me talking   and you know what   it's only been thirty two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me now that's magneto talking what if it never happens   what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy     this place is gonna be one giant cemetery the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility   to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings this   this whole god damn thing   making yourselves into some sort of team of super powered freaks  teaching wayward mutants about classical literature   for what the point of what deal forty eight hours  old man   but if you cross me  i won't feel any guilt about what i do to you a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you  i'm not sure why  but until we find out  i must ask you to stay who i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto what am i doing here and you think it helps calling her rogue if she held on any longer she could have i felt like she almost killed me she borrowed your power to save her life   when she touches someone  she absorbs their strengths    their gifts   in your case    your ability to heal   that's why she keeps her body covered what did she do to me the sun is setting  logan   you've been asleep for nineteen hours why is everybody up at sunrise alive i'll find him enough for a test is it enough a piece   only a piece is that what you're looking for it was xavier's people   they knew how i lost him i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble and what do you do when you wake up to that it does indeed  max doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night   the feeling that some day  some day very soon  they will pass that foolish law   or one just like it   and they will come for you and your children   take you all away i know i wouldn't really have let you die  you know   i just needed   what do you mean to do this checkmate goes to you   i didn't want to hurt anyone   but you leave me no choice what do you mean to do i'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness  charles   and this one gets a front row seat the way what is going to be if i could make you understand   if you could just be made to see it the way i do   the way it's going to be let's just say that i am out to make some radical changes   now come on charles   for old times sake  for your sake     leave him to me you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me  max  what is it like these days still trying to make the world safe for our kind   still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves    definitively is that so what do you want with him the two in alaska   just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time   still tinkering with cerebro not at the cost of lives  max i am trying to save our kind  charles  you should do the same and i'll never understand terrorists i'll never understand your regard for them  charles
